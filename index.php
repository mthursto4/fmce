				<h3>Sustainability...</h3>
				<p>Our present focus is on sustainable development. We are working to familiarize citizens and decision makers in our community with the principles of balanced, sustainable development, to show that preserving and protecting environmental integrity benefits every citizen, now and in the future.</p>

				<h3>Sustainable Communities...</h3>

			<div>
				<h3>Membership...</h3>
				<p>The Federation is open to all organizations which are committed to the principles of environmental protection. Each member organization should designate at least one representative to attend our monthly meetings. Individuals who are active in environmental causes, but do not represent any specific organization are equally welcome.</p>
